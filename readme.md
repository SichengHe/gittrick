###Git tricks
Fork procedures:
#### Fork a repo from the parent repo
*Do some modification
*Push the changes by: git commit -am "some name"
#### Add the parent repo to current directory

#### Get the change from the parent repo to current repo
git pull <nameA>
#### Merge it!
#### After resolving conflicts, push to the repo again and set up a pull request
